floc (flocking): 3d simulation of interacting self-driven particles

midpoint integration of the equations of motion that are continuous in space and time

contains: self-propelling to preferred speed, repulsive radial interactions, 
          noise, time lag, start from ordered or disordered state

compiling: gcc csim3d.c -Wall -lm -O3 -o csim3d
